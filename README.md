# Python etc

Python etc is a ton of posts we made about Python.

1. Subscribe to the Telegram channel for weekly posts: [@pythonetc](https://t.me/s/pythonetc)
2. Read nicely organized past posts on website: [pythonetc.orsinium.dev](https://pythonetc.orsinium.dev/)

## What we write about

1. Python stdlib.
2. Python syntax.
3. PEPs, old and new, including drafts or even rejected.
4. Short Python code snippets.

The posts are written for the Telegram channel first, and so are short both horizontally and verically.

## What we don't post

1. Ad of any kind. Telegram inserts some ad of its own, but we don't get any money from it. And we wish we could get rid of it!
2. Anything about third-party libraries.
3. Anything not about Python, except rare channel announcements.

## Contributing

Psss, wanna write some Python posts for the fame and love? Here, we have a guide for you.

What:

1. Any new posts that fit our ideals described above. Check out [todo.md](./todo.md) if you're need some ideas.
2. Grammar fixes, metadata improvements, and any kind of corrections to the posts.
3. Small improvements to the website.

How:

1. Search the Telegram channel to make sure we haven't covered it before.
2. Fork the project and make the changes. See [Contributing to projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) guide if you're new to open source.
3. Install [task](https://taskfile.dev/)
4. Run `task all` to see if there are any errors.
5. If everything is good, open a PR, and we will review it in a few days.

Happy hacking!
