# 🐍 Python etc

Python etc is over 200 posts about Python stdlib and internals. We're bringing you bite-sized quality content since 2018.

1. 📢 Subscribe to the Telegram channel for weekly posts: [@pythonetc](https://t.me/s/pythonetc)
2. 🌐 Read nicely organized past posts on website: [pythonetc.orsinium.dev](https://pythonetc.orsinium.dev/)

## 👍 What we write about

1. [Python stdlib](https://pythonetc.orsinium.dev/stdlib.html).
2. Python syntax and [new features](https://pythonetc.orsinium.dev/pythons.html).
3. [PEPs](https://pythonetc.orsinium.dev/peps.html), old and new, including drafts or even rejected.
4. Short Python code snippets.

The posts are written for the Telegram channel first, and so are short both horizontally and verically.

## 🙅 What we don't post

1. Ad of any kind. Telegram inserts some ad of its own, but we don't get any money from it. And we wish we could get rid of it!
2. Anything about third-party libraries.
3. Anything not about Python, except rare channel announcements.
